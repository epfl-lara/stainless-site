Stainless
=========

Stainless is a tool for verifying mostly functional programs developed by [LARA](http://lara.epfl.ch) at EPFL. Stainless accepts as its inputs programs in a subset of [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/). Stainless can verify that your program is correct for _all inputs_ and it can also report counterexample inputs for invalid programs. See:
