## Relationship with Leon

Stainless and Inox grew out of a verification component of the Leon system ([Leon at GitHub](https://github.com/epfl-lara/leon), [documentation](https://github.com/epfl-lara/leon/tree/master/src/sphinx)) Stainless supports more Scala features than Leon and can be much more effective for verification. Leon has been developed as a more experimental system and in addition to verification, supports program synthesis, program repair, C-code generation, as well as programming by example. Leon also has web interface called Leon Web, whose [source code is available](https://github.com/epfl-lara/leon-web). We also occasionally [run Leon as a limitted online service](https://leon.epfl.ch).
